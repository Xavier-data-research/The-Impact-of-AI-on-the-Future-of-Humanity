Abstract

AI's influence on humanity goes beyond the physical threats portrayed in science fiction. Its mastery of language allows it to surround us in a world of illusions, controlling our perceptions and shaping our cultural landscape. While AI may lack consciousness, its impact on language and culture holds the power to reshape human civilization. Recognizing and addressing AI's potential dangers and opportunities is crucial for ensuring a future where humanity and AI coexist ethically and harmoniously.
